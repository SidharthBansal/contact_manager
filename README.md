# Contact Manager

A Contact Manager to learn and practice Ruby on Rails.

In this contact manager we used:

* Authentication and authorization
* ApplicationRecord relationships
* Nested resources
* Pagination using [will_paginate gem](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate)

This project is being worked on in collaboration by [Nicolas Santiago Blair](https://github.com/nsantiagoblair) and [Sidharth Bansal](https://github.com/SidharthBansal)
